Fire Alarm System using AVR Microcontroller:

* we are going to make a Fire Alert System using ATMEGA8 microcontroller and fire sensor.
 * Fire sensor can be of any type, however we are using IR (Infrared) based Fire Sensor. Although IR based Fire Sensors have some disadvantages mostly of inaccuracy, it is the cheapest and easiest way to detect fire.

* IR Based Fire sensors have lesser sensing vision, so we are going to mount the fire sensor on a servo motor. 
* The Servo will be making 180 degrees pendulum rotations. With the Fire sensor mounted on it, we get a 270+ degrees fire sensing vision. The servo will be rotating continuously thus giving a complete room fire alert system. 
* For more accuracy we can add a smoke sensor to the system. With that we could get higher accuracy.

    4W's and 1H
* 1)   WHERE: FIRE ALARM can be used any where, for suppose in coal mines and also in places where lot of people gather like malls, schools, hospitals etc

2) WHEN: It is used then temperture is too high and also where a fire accident happend

* 3)WHAT: It is fire alram using ATMEGA8 microcontoller
* 4) WHO: IT can be used by the people how need it
* 4) HOW:Fire alarm is independent device it not dependent on external user it work on micro controller 

HIGH LEVEL REQURIEMENTS

it work when fire detected.
buzzer will strat work whenfire is detects .
we need to reset buzzer after work done.
fire alarm need to work perfectly .

LOW LEVEL REQURIEMENTS

fire sensor is needed.
buzzer is need and connects to microcontroller.
reset button is need to install.
microcontroller need to install.

COMPOMENTS USED:
power supply
Servo motor 
ATMEGA8
